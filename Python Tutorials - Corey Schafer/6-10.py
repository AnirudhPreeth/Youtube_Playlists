Boolean. 
Object Identity : is
When we are using Object Identity we are actually checking if objects have the actual ID.
Or basically whether they are the same object in memory. 
Switch case statement - To check multiple values.
Python doesn't have a switch case statement. Because the if-elif-else statements do the job good enough already. 
Boolean Operations : AND, OR, NOT. 
Two objects can be equal but not the same object in memory. 

False Values : 
False 
None
Zero of any numeric type
Any empty sequence for example, '', (), [].
Any empty mapping, for example, {}.

To determine what Python evaluates to True or False, it's easier to show everything evaluated to False. 
And everything else, by default, evaluate to True.

Two important keywords when working with loops -> break and continue. 
Break ->break out of a loop. 
Continue ->moves on to the next iteration of the loop. 
Loop within a loop. 
While loops will just keep going until a certain condition has been met or until we hit a break.

Functions are basically some instructions packaged together to perform a specific task.  
def keyword -> definition.
It is possible to write a function and have no code in it, but we can't leave it completely blank.
To fill the function later, just type pass keyword.  
Pass keyword is saying we don't want to do anything with this for now, but it won't throw any errors for leaving it blank. 
We need to have the parenthesis when we run our function, in order to execute it. if we don't have those there, then it will be equal to...
...the function itself.    
Functions allow us to reuse our code without having to repeat ourselves. 
"Keeping your code dry" -> Don't repeat yourself. 
Return in function - Means that when we execute our function, its actually gonna be equal to our return value. 
Think of the function as a machine which takes input and produces a result. When you execute a function think of it as a black box.
You don't know how its doing what its doing, you're mainly concerned about the input and the return value. 

The format() method formats the specified value(s) and insert them inside the string's placeholder.
Your required positional arguments have to come before your key word arguments. If you try to give a function without those in order, its going to give an error.
