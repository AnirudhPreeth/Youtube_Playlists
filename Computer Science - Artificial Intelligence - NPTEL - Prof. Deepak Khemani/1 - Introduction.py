AI - Introduction. Video 3. 

The emergence of mind in philosophy. Notion of the mind. 
Correspondence theory of truth. 
Perception is an internal process - Galileo Galilei.
Thinking is the manipulation of symbols - Thomas Hobbes. 
Reasoning = Computation. 
Thoughts = Symbols (Rene Descartes). 
Dualism:Mind and Body. Descartes - A symbol and what it symbolizes are two different things. 
Symbol -> Algebraic manipulation = thinking. 
What it symbolizes -> Subject of thought. Mind != World. 
What makes a notion suitable for symbolizing? What makes a suitable notion actually symbolize?
How can thought and matter interact? -> Mind-body problem. 
John Haugeland - AI the Very Idea. 
Paradox of Mechanical Reason - IF Reasoning is the manipulation of meaningful symbols according to rational rules THEN...
...Who is manipulating the symbols?
It can be either mechanical or meaningful but how can it be both? How can a mechanical manipulator pay attention to meaning?
Humunculus.

John Locke - Father of Classical Liberalism. Mind was a blank state or tabula rasa.

Ontology, Epistemology.
